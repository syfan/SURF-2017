Dear Xin,

I have a preprocessed stratospheric temperature data for demonstration.

Please log on to hiatus.amath. You need to well organize your directories. As a start, in your home directory (/home/xqin/), on the unix command line, execute the following commands:

mkdir model
mkdir model/waccm
mkdir model/waccm/kfl
cd model/waccm/kfl

Now you should be in /home/xqin/model/waccm/kfl/. (Check this by executing pwd.) Then

cp -rL /home/kfli/exhdd2/model/waccm/kfl/4xqin ./

./ means the current directory. Then

cd 4xqin

Here you will find a README file, a number of m-files and a run.com. A README file is important for any one who wants to use the programs. In this case, I just copied what I wrote in this email to the README for record. My convention is that the topmost level program is called MAIN.m and the running script is called run.com. MAIN.m will read a proprocessed NetCDF file of stratospheric temperature, do equatorial/Arctic averaging and plot the time series. To execute MAIN.m, you can execute the following command:

run.com

If the program runs successfully, you should see three output files: nohup.out, Teq.pdf, and Tnp.pdf

nohup.out contains all Matlab messages.
Teq.pdf is the equatorial time series.
Tnp.pdf is the Arctic time series.

To open the PDF files, a good way is to download the files to your computer instead of opening them through the terminal. Download and install Filezilla. Once installed, use "Site Manager" to set up a connection to
hiatus.amath. Choose "SFTP" for protocol. "Host" is 

hiatus.amath.washington.edu.

Leave "Port" blank. Choose normal for Logon Type and put your username and
password below. Then you will be able to log on. Then go to "View" and "Filename filters". Check "Useless Explorer files", "Temporary and backup files", and "Configuration files".

The way to learn is, imagine you are to do exactly what I did, how are you going to write your programs? Make a new directory

/home/xqin/model/waccm/xqin/

and write a program there starting from scratch to read the NetCDF file, do equatorial/Arctic averaging and plot the time series. You will learn a lot through this exercise.

This is the homework for you before I give you the next task. The next task is slightly more complicated.

Let me know at once if you have questions. At your stage, most of the questions would be technical and I usually can resolve them in a minute.

If you are done with temperature, then you can proceed to do the same for
ozone.

Please obtain the data below and plot the ozone time series as for
temperature. Let me know when you are done.

/home/kfli/exhdd2/model/waccm/kfl/preprocessO3/limpasuvan_waccm_monO3.nc

Yes at this stage. But very soon you will have to work on UNIX because the
data will be very large.

At first I want you to repeat exactly what I did in the example. Have you
done it yet?
